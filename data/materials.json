When those trends break (i.e. the most respected trend for the mark up) I begin to look for the last level of major support or even a HTF trend before attempting to get back in.\n\nThis is where the gap fill system comes in for trend traders- H4 trend -> Daily Trend -> Weekly Trend\n\nSimilarly in reverse, when looking for reversal, you want downside momentum to exhaust while people become hyper confident in the new downtrend.\n\nPeople are often wrong early in a trend.\nPeople are often right in the middle of the trend.\nPeople are often wrong late in a trend.",
