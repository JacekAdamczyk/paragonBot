First a larger resting order can act as a magnet for price as the market naturally wants to test liquidity like a game of chicken. Second, if resting orders hold and allow aggressive participants to hit into them, it proves they have real intent. Once you know a larger bid or offer has intent, you must respect it. With time and experience you can better judge how much you need to respect it and for how long\nOne of the most important ways to judge the result of passive orders filling is what market it is. Are these large bids filling on major BTC spot exchanges, which represents real demand to buy. Or are these bids on a major perp contract which only tells us are trapping bears for a rotation up.\n.\nThe following is an example of what spot accumulation in a range will look like and how they probably are distributing it right away\n\nHere is a heatmap of the current BTC range on Bitfinex\nIn Red, starting on the right, we can see agro sellers hitting into the passive bid from 54 to 53\nWith the White arrow we can see the wall placed by the bidders.
