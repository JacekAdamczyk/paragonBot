Are these large bids filling on major BTC spot exchanges, which represents real demand to buy. Or are these bids on a major perp contract which only tells us are trapping bears for a rotation up.\n.\nThe following is an example of what spot accumulation in a range will look like and how they probably are distributing it right away\n\nHere is a heatmap of the current BTC range on Bitfinex\nIn Red, starting on the right, we can see agro sellers hitting into the passive bid from 54 to 53\nWith the White arrow we can see the wall placed by the bidders.

It explains that large, resting bids and asks—often visualized in order books or heatmaps—only matter once they show intent to fill. Larger orders can act as price magnets and signal real market intent when they hold, prompting traders to respect these movements. Successfully interpreting these signals requires understanding the market and differentiating between genuine demand and tactical positioning. Examples are given using a BTC spot exchange heatmap, where aggressive sellers interact with a significant bid wall, demonstrating the importance of respecting substantial orders.",

Key concepts include the VWAP itself, deviation bands, and previous values, with AMT (auction market theory) influencing the profile logic. Trading strategies involve reversion and momentum systems, with entry/exit based on volume and risk managed via deviation bands and previous values. Reversion strategies use a flat slope and target VWAP during low volume entries, while momentum strategies use a sloped VWAP with high volume entries. The video also distinguishes between swing (trend following), intraday (reversion), and scalp (reversion or momentum",

        "content": "A cheat sheet I made for myself last year as far as sentiment along a trend. \n\nYou should only look for trend exhaustion when momentum stops agreeing with the consensus direction.\n\nIn market terms, a mark up will likely be a thin move before a longer consolidation starts to form- people often start to say things like \"This looks heavy\"\nFor my system, mark ups are usually carried along a strong H4 trend or even a daily trend. When those trends break (i.e. the most respected trend for the mark up) I begin to look for the last level of major support or even a HTF trend before attempting to get back in.\n\nThis is where the gap fill system comes in for trend traders- H4 trend -> Daily Trend -> Weekly Trend\n\nSimilarly in reverse, when looking for reversal, you want downside momentum to exhaust while people become hyper confident in the new downtrend.\n\nPeople are often wrong early in a trend.\nPeople are often right in the middle of the trend.\nPeople are often wrong late in a trend.",

    "summary": "The cheat sheet outlines a strategy for identifying trend exhaustion in trading, focusing on momentum and sentiment. It explains that traders should look for signs of trend exhaustion when momentum no longer aligns with the consensus direction. The document details how mark-ups often precede consolidations, tracked along strong H4 or daily trends. It suggests looking for major support levels or higher timeframe (HTF) trends when these trends break. The strategy also applies to reversals, noting that traders should seek exhaustion in downside momentum as confidence in the new downtrend rises. It highlights common patterns where traders' perceptions often vary at different stages of a trend.",
